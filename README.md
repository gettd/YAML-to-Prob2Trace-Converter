# YAML to Prob2Trace Converter

This script converts `.yaml` simulation output files into `.prob2trace`, **Prob2Trace**-compatible format, applying necessary **calculations and transformations** based on deceleration test scenarios.

The `.yaml` input files are generated from simulation experiments using **Autoware with AWSIM**, specifically in **deceleration scenarios**. While the script has not been tested on other JAMA framework scenarios (e.g., cut-in, cut-out), it may still be compatible.

---

## What Can It Do?

- Automatically converts all `.yaml` files inside the `/Input` folder
- Modifies and calculates relevant values
- Saves converted traces into the `/Output` folder in `.prob2trace` format

## Repository Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Input/                  # Place your raw YAML files here
â”œâ”€â”€ Output/                 # Converted Prob2Trace-compatible files will be saved here
â”œâ”€â”€ yamlToProb2trace.py     # Main script for conversion logic
```

---

## How to Run

> Make sure your `.yaml` files are inside the `./Input` folder.

Then run:
```bash
python yamlToProb2trace.py
```

> All converted files will be automatically written to `./Output`.

## Dependencies

This script uses only the Python standard library:

- `pathlib`

> No additional packages required.

## Notes

- The system is currently tailored for **deceleration scenario** outputs from AWSIM + Autoware.
- Other JAMA driving test patterns (e.g., cut-in/cut-out) have not yet been verified.
- Contributions and test reports on other scenarios are welcome!
